Song Popularity Prediction Project: From Data Preprocessing to Model Evaluation

Data Collection:
Download the song data from Kaggle.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use various EDA techniques to understand the dataset's characteristics:
Check the shape of the dataset.
Calculate the number of unique values in each column.
Use value_counts to analyze categorical variables.
Check for missing values using isnull().sum().
Identify duplicate rows.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values through imputation.
Remove duplicate rows to ensure data quality.

Target Variable Analysis:
Explore the distribution of the target variable (song popularity) to understand its characteristics.

Data Visualization:
Create visualizations for categorical features (bar plots, pie charts) and numerical features (histograms, box plots).
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

Handling Outliers:
Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to avoid their undue influence on the model.

Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's generalization performance.

Feature Scaling:
Apply standardization to numerical features to ensure they have similar scales, which can improve the performance of certain models.

Correlation Matrix:
Create a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between numerical features and the target variable.

Model Building - Linear Regression:
Choose Linear Regression as the model for song popularity prediction due to its simplicity and interpretability.
Train the Linear Regression model on the training data.

Model Testing and Evaluation:
Test the trained model on the testing dataset.
Compute Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score to evaluate model performance.
Generate a classification report to assess the model's precision, recall, and F1-score (classification report is typically used for classification tasks; ensure you meant regression metrics here).
